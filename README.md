14 Clients | Worked on 7 projects that are in production | 2 Research
### Hi there 👋 
This is Mossaddak, love to make something creative as well as play with IDE🤷‍♀️.
I've been involved in web development since 2021, completing 63 solo projects and collaborating on various group-based projects, including those related to machine learning. Additionally, I've worked with 14 clients worldwide.

I work to develop something with a focus on some aspects like the website design must be carefully tailored. Attractive visuals and smooth animations are enable to leave a positive impression on customers. Finally, It needs a robust backend for efficient functionality.

I successfully worked on two research projects with different groups, and both studies were accepted by international journals.

When I'm free, I usually love to plan to travel 🏕, and I thoroughly enjoy it.🌱
